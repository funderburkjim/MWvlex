A first crude extraction from MW of information regarding verbs.
Historical note: verb_step0a.txt is comparable to an older verb-prep4.out.


There are 5 criteria for roots:
K : record contains form <key2>.*?</root></key2>
P : record contains <vlex type="preverb"></vlex>
V : record contains <vlex type="root"></vlex>
N : record contains <vlex>Nom.</vlex> 
O : record has none of the above forms AND it contains <vlex
    Not sure what these are 
Here are the summary results found in verb_step0a.txt:
10418  records written to  verb_step0a.txt
P 31
K 6386
N 1213
V 2088
O  700
